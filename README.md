1. **Department-wise performance analysis** - Identify underperforming departments
2. **Top 3 important factors** affecting employee performance  
3. **Predictive model** for employee performance assessment
4. **Actionable recommendations** for performance improvement

## Business Context & Challenges

### Current Situation
- **Service delivery escalations** have increased significantly
- **Client satisfaction** dropped by 8 percentage points
- Need to maintain **top employer reputation** while improving performance
- Challenge to identify non-performing employees without affecting overall morale

### Strategic Objectives
- Restore client satisfaction to previous levels
- Reduce service delivery escalations
- Maintain company's reputation as a best employer
